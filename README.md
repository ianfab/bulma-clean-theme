# bulma-simple-theme

This is a simple Jekyll Theme built with the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework, based on the [Bulma Clean Theme by C.S. Rhymes](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme), providing a modern-looking site to start with.

The theme uses [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for its interactive components, such as mobile navbar and notifications.

## Installation

If you are deploying to GitHub pages, then you can install the [GitHub Pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) and use `remote_theme` instead of `theme` in your `_config.yml`. **Note that the GitHub Pages gem requires Jekyll version 3.9.**

```yaml
# With GitHub Pages Gem
remote_theme: ianfab/bulma-simple-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bulma-simple-theme

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is set up just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
